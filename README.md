# File Monitor Shell Script

This repository contains a simple shell script that monitors the existence of a file called `~/file.txt` using a combination of `while` and `until` loops. Depending on whether the file exists or not, the script will perform different actions.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine.

2. Make the shell script executable:
   chmod +x monitor.sh

3. Run the script:
   ./monitor.sh

   The script will continuously monitor the existence of the `~/file.txt` file and print messages accordingly.

## Purpose

This script is intended for educational and demonstration purposes, illustrating how to create a basic file monitoring mechanism using shell scripting. It serves as a starting point for those who want to develop more complex monitoring solutions or learn about shell scripting.
